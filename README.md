# MasterySkills
List of skills I want to master, and things that help me get there.  I've been developing applications for about 6 years now in various languages, learned various computer science concepts, and hacked my way through a lot of projects.  Now, I am narrowing my focus to mastering a set of core languages, technologies and frameworks.  This will help document the resources I'm using, and hopefully give others a path to mastering them as well.
